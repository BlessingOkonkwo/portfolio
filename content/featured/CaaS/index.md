CaaS (Compliance as a Service) is a cloud-based solution that helps businesses and financial institutions meet regulatory requirements efficiently. It automates compliance processes such as transaction monitoring, risk assessment, identity verification (KYC/KYB), and reporting. CaaS platforms integrate with existing systems to ensure organizations stay compliant with industry regulations, reduce fraud risks, and avoid legal penalties. By leveraging automation, real-time analytics, and secure data management, CaaS enables companies to focus on their core operations while maintaining regulatory compliance with minimal effort.
